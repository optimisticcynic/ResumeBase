\section{Work Experience}

\vspace{6pt}

\cventrylong{2013--Present}{Research Assistant-Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment}{University of Minnesota}{Minneapolis, MN}{}{\vspace{3pt}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Performed upgrades of the CMS detector in France through the installation and testing of new hardware. Added functionality to the graphical interface.
    \item Worked as the expert on-call to diagnose and fix problems in the data-taking software and hardware of CMS.
    \item Worked to design and create C++ software to preform analytics: discriminate whether to save data or discard it on an event-by-event basis,  allowing for a larger amount of useful data to be collected, which is used in creating new datasets.
    \item Modified simulation software with an innovative algorithm modeling new 
parameter values, allowing the examination of relationship between the parameters and measured variables.
    \item Implemented simulations on component upgrades to the CMS detector forecasting their effect on possible new measurements.
    %\item Experienced traveling multi-nationally
    \item Worked with people in multiple cultures and time-zones on a cooperative project. 
\end{itemize}
}


\cventrylong{2012--Present}{Teaching Assistant}{University of Minnesota}{Minneapolis, MN}{}{\vspace{3pt}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Taught multiple lectures with different sections of students, from engineering to business majors, personalizing the lecture depending on the particular section's strengths and weaknesses.
    \item Evaluated students in both their ability to function in groups as well as their individual aptitude in problem solving and mathematics.
    \item Hosted one-on-one meetings with students to aid them in their understanding of the subject and help prepare them for future assignments.
\end{itemize}
}


\cventrylong{2010--2012}{ Research Assistant}{Minnesota State College}{Mankato, MN}{}{\vspace{3pt}
\begin{itemize}
	\item  Maintained and ran  a 400 KeV Van de Graaff accelerator. This included both working directly with the accelerator itself as well as diagnosing and fixing issues with the control modules components, which required skilled use of circuit
diagrams. 
    \item  Investigation of an existing apparatus to harvest the nitrogen-13 created from a graphite target. This included fabrication, testing and revising the original plans to make it function safely and effectively. 
\end{itemize}
}

\cventrylong{2010--2012}{Teaching Assistant}{Minnesota State College}{Mankato, MN}{}{\vspace{3pt}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Organized and led introductory physics classes to prepare students for more mathematically rigorous physics classes
    \item Provided one-on-one coaching for physics and math students of all levels to help them excel in their classes.
\end{itemize}
